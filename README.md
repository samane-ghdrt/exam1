## Fullstack Online Store Challenge

In this challenge, you will build a fullstack online store using Next.js. The goal is to create a functional e-commerce website with essential features.

## Project Overview

You can find reference images of the website layout in the `images` folder. **However, your website does not have to match the provided design exactly.** You only need to use a CSS framework (such as Tailwind, MUI, etc.) to ensure a presentable and user-friendly UI.

## Initial Data:
Since there is no admin panel or form to add products, you can use one of the following methods to provide initial data:
- A local JSON file (data/products.json) loaded into your app.
- A seed script to insert sample data into your database.(like "insertmany" function in mongodb)

A mock API (e.g., using json-server).
## Approach

1. **Home & Shop Pages:**  
   - Create a home page and a shop page displaying available products.

2. **Product Details Page:**  
   - Implement a dynamic product page that displays details for each item.  
   - Users should be able to add products to the cart.

3. **Cart Page:**  
   - Show selected products along with their prices.  
   - Automatically calculate the total order amount.

4. **Database Integration:**  
   - Connect to a database (e.g., MongoDB) to store and manage contact information.

5. **Styling:**  
   - Use any UI framework or library (e.g., MUI, Tailwind) to style the application.

Good luck!
